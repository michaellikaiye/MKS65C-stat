# MKS65C-stat
2018-10-30 stat (not cat) your files!
There is a function called stat. It is used to get information about a file. With your table buddy, write a program that uses stat to display the following information about a file:
file size
mode (permissions)
time of last access (displayed in the following format: Fri Oct 28 09:03:01 2016
Note
You may hardcode the file that your program uses, make sure the program works when I download and run it.
If only there were some file that you know I will have and where it is... hmm...
Once you have that, try the following:
Modify the size so it is printed out in human readable form (that is using B, KB, MB, GB).
You may want to look into the sprintf function to help.
Attempt to print out the permissions in ls -l form, ignoring the early bits that include the file type information
Permissions are of type mode_t, which is an integer type.
The permissions section of the mode is stored in the last 9 bits of the mode_t data type.
